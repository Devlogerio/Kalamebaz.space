This is a turn base online game where each round the chosen player will choose a word and draw it! others should guess, faster you guess, more score you get, This similar to skribble.io
Optimised and tested on Android/IOS phones and All existing browsers.

## Game is made as my final project for my bachelor's degree in the Iran Tehran North Azad university, the score was 20 out of 20 Iran univerisy scoring system; The reason of making this game is the lak of capabilities of Skribbl.io game for phones so I had to come up with an idea to implement the same thing but for phone and Farsi language as well, documentation is also icluded in the package

## About the making
This game was made using Adobe PhoneGap/P5js(very little)/Nodejs/socket.io and took around 5 months of development.
This game is in Farsi language, With the ability to work in English with a few tweaks
## Documentation is in Farsi language sorry

IMPORTANT NODE: The PhoneGap project has had huge changes during the past years, so this project may not work

## How to run:
1) Install PhoneGap and use the client folder as the app on it
2) Install nodejs
3) Install libraries (express, socket.io, victors)
4) Type (npm install) in the terminal
5) Run the server using (node server/app.js) in the terminal
6) Open the page on localhost://port (the port is 2000)
7) Or open the app from your device
## Doesnt work on Android versions less than 5 <I had to say, just in case>

## About the versions:
Every single change is submitted and documented as files and backups on my backup hard drives, If you have any request or question about previous versions of this game or any other of my games, you should call me, I am unable to document every single of my changes on GitHub so everything is backed up other places and only the final version/versions are here.
<I have the code from empty to full final version as files!>

## Reason of being open source
Github private repository is forbidden in my country so I decided to make all of my games open source for public
