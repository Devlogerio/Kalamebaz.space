This is a turn base online game where each round the chosen player will choose a word and draw it! others should guess, faster you guess, more score you get, This similar to skribble.io
Optimised and tested on Android/IOS phones and All existing browsers.

## Game is made as my final project for my bachelor's in the Iran Tehran North Azad university, the score was 20/20; The reason of making this game is the lak of capabilities of Skribbl.io game for phones so I had to come up with an Idea to Implement the same thing but for phone and Farsi language as well, documentation is also icluded in the package

## About the making
This game was made using Adobe Phonegap/P5js(very little)/Nodejs/socket.io, took around 5 months of developement.
This game is in Farsi language, With ability of work in English with few tweaks

## Doesnt work on Android versions less than 5 <I had to say, just in case>

## About the versions:
Every single change is submitted and documented as files and backups on my backup hard drives, If you have any request or question about previus versions of this game or any other of my fames, you should call me, I am unable to document every single of my changes on github so everything is backed up other places and only thefinal version/versions is here.
<I have the code from empty to full final version as files!>

## Reason of being open source
Github private repository is forbidden in my country so I decided to make all of my games open source for public
