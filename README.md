This is a turn-based online game where each round the chosen player will choose a word and draw it! others should guess, the faster you guess, the higher score you get, This similar to skribble.io
Optimized and tested on Android/IOS phones and All existing browsers.

## Game was made as my final project for my bachelor's degree at the Iran Tehran North Azad University, The score was 20 out of 20 Iran University scoring system; The reason for making this game is the lack of capabilities of Skribbl.io game for phones so I had to come up with an idea to implement the same thing but for phone and Farsi language as well, documentation is also included in the package

## About the making
This game was made using Adobe PhoneGap/P5js(very little)/Nodejs/socket.io and took around 5 months of development.
This game is in Farsi language, With the ability to work in English with a few tweaks
## Documentation is in Farsi language sorry

IMPORTANT NODE: The PhoneGap project has had huge changes during the past years, so this project may not work

## How to run:
1) Install PhoneGap and use the client folder as the app on it
2) Install nodejs
3) Install libraries (express, socket.io, victors)
4) Type (npm install) in the terminal
5) Run the server using (node server/app.js) in the terminal
6) Open the page on localhost://port (the port is 2000)
7) Or open the app from your device
## Doesnt work on Android versions less than 5 <I had to say, just in case>
